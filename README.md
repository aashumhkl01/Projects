Customer churn:

The customer churn prediction project not only provide valuable insights into customer behaviour, 
but also empowered the organization to take proactive measures in retaining the customers.

In this project I have developed the model to help organization proactively identify and retain at-risk 
customers,the primary goal was to leverage analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast 
customer churn and in turn reduce revenue loss.
